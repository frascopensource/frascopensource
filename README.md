# Hi there I'm  Salvatore FrasconÃ  ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **DevOps Engineer** and a **Software Developer**. I have been obsessed with problem solving for years now. As the years passed, I realized that I needed a common language to express my vision, so I asked myself, what is the best language for problem solving? I conclude that math (added to computing power) is the key.
